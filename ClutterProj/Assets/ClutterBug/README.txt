HOW TO USE

Clutter you want to spawn requires a collider on it

To prevent overlapping clutter, create a layer named "Clutter", and make sure the allow overlap bool is off

To have clutter spawn "child" clutter, simply attach the ChildClutter script to the prefab you are creating in the editor, then add other prefabs into the gameobject list.
